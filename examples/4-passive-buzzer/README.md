# 4-passive-buzzer

This example is inspired from the [Tone](https://code.google.com/archive/p/rogue-code/wikis/ToneLibraryDocumentation.wiki) library to play a melody using a passive buzzer.

You can find the rust constants for all pitches at `src/tone/pitches.rs` and use them with:

```rust
// import all
use rust-arduino-elegoo::tone::pitches::*
```
